                     Usman later made up his mind to join the Army, and despite the limited opportunities
                      for Indians to get commissioned ranks and despite intense competition, he succeeded in
                       gaining admission to the prestigious Royal Military College, Sandhurst (RMC) He
                        entered RMC in 1932, was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and appointed to the
                         Unattached List for the Indian Army on 1 February 1934. He was attached in India
                          to the 1st battalion of the Cameronians on 12 March 1934 for a year.As a Muslim, Usman became a symbol of India's 
                     inclusive secularism. At the time of the partition of India he with many other Muslim
                      officers declined to move to the Pakistan Army and continued to serve with the Indian Army.
                      He was martyred in July 1948 while fighting Pakistani soldiers and militia in Jammu and
                       Kashmir. He was later awarded the second highest Indian military decoration
                     for gallantry in the face of enemy, the Maha Vir Chakra.......

                            He decided to join the army, considering that it would give him an "identity and 
                            purpose".
                     Singh joined the British Indian Army in 1936 and served in the 1st battalion of the Sikh
                      Regiment. During the 1962 Sino-Indian War, he was commanding a platoon at the Bum La Pass in
                       the North-East Frontier Agency. Though heavily outnumbered, he bravely led his troops
                        against a Chinese assault and defended his post until he was wounded and captured. Singh 
                        died from his injuries while in Chinese custody.[2] He single-handedly killed more than 50
                         Chinese soldiers, 
                    and became a war hero within the Indian Armed forces.[3].......

    Brig Sant Singh, whom the freedom fighters in 1971 fondly called “Brigadier Babaji” because 
      of his attire – typical Sikh turban and beard and affectionate attitude, was an officer in
       the Indian Army. He was one of the six officers of the Indian Army to have been twice
         decorated with the Maha Vir Chakra, India's second highest war time military decoration.
      Singh was commissioned into the Sikh Light Infantry on 16 February 1947 on a short-service
      commission, receiving a regular commission in the Indian Army as a lieutenant on 15
     August 1951.He took over as the commander of the Sikh Light Infantry in 1964 and led

                      Colonel Thakur Prithi Chand, was an officer of the Indian Army. He is known for his
                       significant role in stalling Pakistani advances in Ladakh during the Indo-Pakistan War
                        of 1947-48. 
                        In 1933-34, Prithi Chand got recruited in the 11/17 Dogra Regiment. In 1936, 
                        he was appointed as Jamadar under the Viceroy's Commission. 
                        In 1939, Chand was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant through the King's Commission, into the
                         2nd Battalion of the Dogra Infantry Regiment in 1939.
                        There seems to be some confusion regarding Chand's service number. 
                        B. Chakravorty mentions it as IEC - 787, while the website of the 
                        Ministry of Defence, Government of India, mentions it as IEC - 8968.For his role in
                         this war, Thakur Prithi Chand is regarded among the 'Saviours of Ladakh',
                       alongside Kushal Chand, Bhim Chand, and Chewang Rinchen.........
