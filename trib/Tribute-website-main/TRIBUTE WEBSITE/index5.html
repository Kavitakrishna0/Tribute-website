                Colonel Thakur Prithi Chand, was an officer of the Indian Army. He is known for his
                 significant role in stalling Pakistani advances in Ladakh during the Indo-Pakistan War
                  of 1947-48. 
                  In 1933-34, Prithi Chand got recruited in the 11/17 Dogra Regiment. In 1936, 
                  he was appointed as Jamadar under the Viceroy's Commission. 
                  In 1939, Chand was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant through the King's Commission, into the
                   2nd Battalion of the Dogra Infantry Regiment in 1939.
                  There seems to be some confusion regarding Chand's service number. 
                  B. Chakravorty mentions it as IEC - 787, while the website of the 
                  Ministry of Defence, Government of India, mentions it as IEC - 8968.For his role in
                   this war, Thakur Prithi Chand is regarded among the 'Saviours of Ladakh',
                 alongside Kushal Chand, Bhim Chand, and Chewang Rinchen.........

                      to the 1st battalion of the Cameronians on 12 March 1934 for a year.As a Muslim, Usman became a symbol of India's 
                 inclusive secularism. At the time of the partition of India he with many other Muslim
                  officers declined to move to the Pakistan Army and continued to serve with the Indian Army.
