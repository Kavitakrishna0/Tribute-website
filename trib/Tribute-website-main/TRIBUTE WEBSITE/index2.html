                    Major Shaitan Singh Bhati, was an Indian Army officer and recipient of India's highest 
                    military decoration, the Param Vir Chakra. Singh was born in Rajasthan. On completing his
                     graduation, Singh joined the Jodhpur State Forces. He was transferred to the Kumaon Regiment 
                     after the princely state of Jodhpur was merged into India. He took part in operations in the
                      Naga Hills and also in the 1961 Indian annexation of Goa.During the Sino-Indian War, 13th 
                      Battalion of Kumaon Regiment was stationed in the Chushul sector. C Company, under the
                       command of Singh, was holding a position at Rezang La. In the morning hours of 18 November
                        1962, the Chinese attacked. The Indians fought until their last rounds, before eventually 
                         being overpowered by the Chinese. During the battle, Singh continuously moved from post 
                         to post reorganizing the defences and boosting the morale of his men. As he moved between
                          the posts without any cover, he was seriously wounded, and later succumbed to his 
                          injuries. For his actions on 18 November 1962, 
                    Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.......

                    Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria,  was an Indian Army officer and member of a United 
                    Nations peacekeeping force. Salaria was an alumnus of King George's Royal Indian Military 
                    College and the National Defence Academy (NDA). He was the first NDA alumnus and is the only
                     UN Peacekeeper to be awarded a Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India's highest 
                     wartime military decoration.In December 1961, Salaria was among the Indian troops deployed to the
                     Republic of the Congo as part of the United Nations Operation in the 
                     Congo. On 5 December, as part of Operation Unokat, Salaria's battalion 
                     was tasked to clear a roadblock of two armoured cars manned by 150

                       Elizabethville Airport. The plan was that Salaria and his men were

                       the Katangese armoured cars. During the attack,
                          Salaria was shot twice in the neck and eventually succumbed to his 
                          injuries.  For his duty and courage, and disregard for his own safety during the battle, Salaria was awarded the PVC........

                    Subedar Joginder Singh Sahnan,  was an Indian Army soldier who posthumously received India's 
                    highest military gallantry award, the Param Vir Chakra. Joginder Singh was born on 26
                     September 1921 in Mahla Kalan, Moga district, Punjab, British India.
                            He decided to join the army, considering that it would give him an "identity and 
                            purpose".
                     Singh joined the British Indian Army in 1936 and served in the 1st battalion of the Sikh
                      Regiment. During the 1962 Sino-Indian War, he was commanding a platoon at the Bum La Pass in
                       the North-East Frontier Agency. Though heavily outnumbered, he bravely led his troops
                        against a Chinese assault and defended his post until he was wounded and captured. Singh 
                        died from his injuries while in Chinese custody.[2] He single-handedly killed more than 50
                         Chinese soldiers, 
                    and became a war hero within the Indian Armed forces.[3].......
